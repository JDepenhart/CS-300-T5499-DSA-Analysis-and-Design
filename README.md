# CS-300-T5499-DSA-Analysis-and-Design
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  The two projects of this course revolved around choosing an appropriate data structure to hold course information obtained from a file. Once a data structure was chosen, I then needed to     
  code a program to perform the tasks of file validation, storing data, printing data, and searching the data structure.  I wrote pseudocode for several structures as well as the other     
  functions of this program. I then performed runtime analysis to determine the structure that best suited my needs. Lastly, I wrote the program. 
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  After reading the program requirements, I determined that a vector would fit the specifications the best. Vectors are easily sorted and easy to load data into. This program had a file that   
  contained course information that needed to be stored and sorted. The data would be stored in a file, so only an initial loading of data was required, i.e., no inserting function was needed 
  to add data after the initial loading. Vectors also have established sorting functions that fit the projectâ€™s requirements for sorting and printing information perfectly. 
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  Most roadblocks were overcome by stepping back and reassessing the problem. If I had issues understanding a concept, I could easily find websites that explained it in more detail.  
  Ultimately, I was able to logic my way through most of my problems by simply doing more research on the topic. 
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  This project introduced new concepts that I have never used before. Learning about more data structures and how each one is used will help me write better storage systems and algorithms in 
  the future. I now understand more about each data structure and when to implement them. 
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  This project introduced me to recursion, which could help me in the future with how I write programs. However, in terms of maintainable, readable, and adaptable code, I have not evolved 
  much. I have already been in the habit of commenting my code and considering object-oriented concepts.
